<p>My name is Kerk Day, and I am a web developer and freelance designer. I recently graduated from a two year degree in Software Development at SAIT Polytechnic, and am currently looking for work.</p>

<p>Email me <a href="mailto:work@kerkday.com?subject=Hey, I think you'd be a great fit here">here</a> if you’re looking to hire!</p>

<p>So far, I’ve had the opportunity to create designs and websites for a few local businesses and personalities. Some of my early public work includes some poster designs and promotional materials for <a href="https://trapped.ca/locations/calgary.html">Trapped Calgary</a>, and a logo for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clubmryyc/">Club MR</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, I’ve been working with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/albearta">The Fellowship of Alberta Bears</a> on replacing their old and outdated website, and with some friends to make a cover for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theworldatnightpodcast">The World at Night Podcast</a>. I’ve also spent my quarantine time learning about the different technologies I’ve seen posted on job offerings.</p>

<p>Most notable things I’ve practiced with are Vue.js and React.js for front end development;   Node.js with Express.js, Golang, and PHP;   as well as working with remote servers like Amazon Web Services(AWS) and Vultr.<br />
I chose Vultr because I had a lot of free credit for their services, and their service is really simple to operate. They’re quite similar to Digital Ocean in that regard.</p>

<p>I am constantly working to better myself and to make a dent in this technological landscape. Thank you for looking at my website, I hope you found it entertaining.</p>
